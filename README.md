# Line Following Robot

This repository contains the code and documentation for a line following robot project developed from March 2023 to June 2023.

## Overview

The Line Following Robot project involved designing and constructing a robot capable of autonomously following a line. It utilized Lego Mindstorm EV3 and MicroPython to implement precise algorithms for navigation and performance optimization.

## Features

- Autonomous line-following capability
- Improved navigation accuracy by 20% using MicroPython algorithm
- Efficiency improvements in system performance and development time

## Technologies Used

- Lego Mindstorm EV3
- MicroPython
- Python for integration, testing, and enhancements
- Jira for project management and documentation

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on a local machine, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

- Lego Mindstorm EV3 kit
- Python environment with MicroPython support
- Jira account for project management


### Notes:

- **Branches**: Adjust the instructions in the `Installation` section to specify how to switch between different branches (`version1`, `version2`, `version3`) depending on the customer needs.
- **Last Updated**: Replace `"June 2023"` with the actual month and year when you last update the `README.md` file.

By following this structure, your `README.md` file will provide clear and concise information about your Line Following Robot project, its features, how to get started, and how others can contribute. Adjust the content further as per your specific project details and preferences.
